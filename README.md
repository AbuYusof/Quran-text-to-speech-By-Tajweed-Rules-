# Quran-text-to-speech-By-Tajweed-Rules-Beta.1.0

Added the ability to read the text-to-speech engine of Google or any text-to-speech engine to pronounce the Holy Quran with the rules of Tajweed.
--

These rules programmed in the XML language are imported into any application that has this feature, as it reconfigures the Quranic verses according to the provisions of intonation, and sends the text ready to the text-to-speech engine to read it, as the rules of intonation were relied upon in that.
This project is still experimental and the rules can be re-edited according to what is correct if there are any shortcomings or future development.
I recommend using the T2S app on Android, Libra, or any app that gives the option to use search and replace rules and RegExp.

It is recommended that this code be imported into the Android application:
